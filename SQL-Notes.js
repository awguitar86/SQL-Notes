/*** SQL ***/

/* Relational Database */
// A database which is structured to show the relationships between data. They are like giant connected excel spreadsheets.
// Uses tables with columns and rows which relate to one another.

/* Primary Keys */
// Any one column assigned to identity each row; must be unique and constant.
// Using an ID column is a very common solution - makes it easy to connecy with other tables.
// The email or username can also be used as the primary key, but there can be problems with that.
